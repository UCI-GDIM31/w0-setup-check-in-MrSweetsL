# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hello! My name is Sarah Lee and my pronouns are she/her. I like Fantasy RPG Adventure games and I'm currently playing Baldur's Gate 3, an rpg based on Dungeons and Dragons, honour mode. I also play Splatoon 3, Fire emblem series, and Stardew Valley. I'm taking this class because I want to make games as a career! I've made a visual novel game using Scratch in high school, but other than that I didn't have the best programming class experience in high school. I hope to make rpg games, but I'd also like to explore making other games as well.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [x] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I'm hoping to learn the foundation of programming games! I want to make video games >:D

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm nervous that I might not be able to remember all the code that I will learn when I start making a program ;^;

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

I've learned Java script through code.org but I used the block coding so I don't have a good memory of it. As long as I know what each piece of code does I can figure out how to fix any bugs!

2. Game development (any engine)

I used Scratch for a previous game project.

3. Unity

I've never used unity before ToT

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
N/A
2. Scope management
N/A
3. Iteration
N/A
4. Object-Oriented programming
